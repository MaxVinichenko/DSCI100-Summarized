    "1. Classification: Predict a new class/category for a new observation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive: asks bout summarized characteristics of data, no interpretation.\n",
    "    - Ex: How many ppl live in each province in Canada?\n",
    "2. Exploratory: asks whether there are patterns, trends or relationships within a single data set; often to develop a hypothesis for further studies.\n",
    "    - Ex: Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth in a set of 2k ppl in Canada?\n",
    "3. Predictive: a question that asks about predicting a *measurement* / *label* for observations. Focus on what things predict what outcome, NOT what causes the outcome.\n",
    "    - Ex: What political party will a person vote for in next election.\n",
    "4. Inferential: A question that looks for patterns, trends or relationships in a single data set **and** a quantification of how applicable these findings are to the wider population. \n",
    "    - Ex: Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth for *all people* in Canada?\n"
